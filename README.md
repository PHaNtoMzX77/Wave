```

You'll also need to download the online installer, once downloaded open up Windows Explorer and right click on the file, then click on 'Properties' and check 'Unblock'.

**Step 1**

Double click on the online installer file to start it up, depending on your system it may take a few moments. Once it starts you should be greeted with a screen
asking for your language, select the language you use then click on the 'Next' button (there is also accessibility settings if needed) to begin the setup.

**Step 2**

On the next screen, you'll need to either login to your Wave Account or create a new one, if you create a new one you will be redirected to a website where you
can make one. After you have done either, you can click 'Login to account' to move on to the next step.

**Step 2**

After logging in, you will need to select how you want Wave to download & install updates, it is recommended to have Automatic updates on so your always secure
but you may want to have wave only download updates instead of installing them incase there is an issue with a new update. However disabling updates all together
is an option but will put your copy of Wave, and potentially your main computer at risk of malicous software.

**Step 3**

Next, you need to choose your express settings. These are general privacy and feature settings that can give you more privacy or features at the expense of 
your experience or giving you a better experience.

**Step 4**

Get ready to install Wave, because this next screen is where you are going to install it. Make sure you have a stable internet connection and some free time
as this process can take anywhere from 1-2 minutes on capable hardware to 10-20 minutes. During this time just sit back and relax as we do the work for you.

**Step 5**

Once the install is done, you'll have the option to either restart into Wave or just exit the installer. Either way, you now have a shortcut in your start menu
so you can start up Wave from the click of a button.

## Support
### Wave Support Lifecycle: (Mainstream Release)
Wave runs on a quartly release cycle and each version is supported for up to 6 months with up to 2 months extended support for a
total of 8 months of support. 

With mainstream support you'll receive feature updates every 2 months, as well as monthly Quality & Performance roll-up updates and weekly
security updates.

With extended support, you'll get two more months of Quality & Performance roll-up updates and your weekly security updates. But no
additional features or services. At the end of extended support you'll have around a week to update before the latest update will require a
newer version to install that version.
### Wave Support Lifecycle: (Long-term Servicing)
Wave also has an LTS version that runs on a semi-annual release cycle, each version is supported for 8 months and up to 4 months extended 
support for a total of 12 months/an entire year.

With LTS you only have one version that you use for the rest of the support cycle, in mainstream support, each version is updated with
monthly Quality & Performance roll-up updates and weekly security updates still, but you don't get any feature updates.

With each LTS versions extended support window, you only get weekly security updates. No Quality & Performance roll-up updates. These
are only really important security updates that keep your system secure for the last 16 weeks of support.
### Wave Support Lifecycle: (Legacy Systems Edition)
Wave also has a smaller Edition called Wave LSE, this version runs a seperate GUI framework and is much more lightweight. It is primarily
built for old computers that need an extra stretch of life.

You'll get your quartly updates but they will be less feature-rich as porting modern features to legacy is difficult, you'll still get
normal monthly Quality & Performance updates and weekly security updates, these updates are essential for maintenance.

Extended support is a little longer here, mainstream will end after 6 months like normal but extended ends after 4 months like LTS, which
gives your system 10 months of support. Extended support only gets security updates here to keep the system secure.

## Translations
The goal of Wave is to have a universally accessible PPTOS, one that can be used in ANY language. So I have to thank everyone who 
translated Wave to their own language, this also serves as a list of available languages.

legacy for these PowerPoint versions.
